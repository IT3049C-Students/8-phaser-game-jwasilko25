## Self-Reflection:
I was able to find tutorials online about diffferent Phaser games. The hard part was finding spritesheets that worked and were free to use. I'm still struggling to get my body spritesheet to cooperate but I don't know how to fix that. Other than that the game seems to be operating fine.
